            <h4>Forecasting Breakdown</h4>
            <p>
                Time series data can be broken down into trend, seasonal and random aspects. Forecast models attempt to
                fit these aspects in past data to predict future observations of the series. A trend is the tendency for the series
                to steadily increase or decrease. Seasonality describes a consistently repeating pattern which repeats
                every given period (eg. weekly, quarterly or annual periods). The random aspect of the data is caused
                by noise or external factors which cannot be accounted for by analyzing past data points.<br>
                <br>
                The ARIMA model is the most popular for modelling time series. ARIMA is appropriate for time series with
                or without a trend but is not appropriate for seasonal data. Holt or Exponential Weighted
                Moving Average (EWMA) can also be used to model trend. When seasonality is involved SARIMA and
                Holt-Winters models should be used. If the series data exhibits neither trend nor seasonality
                simpler approaches such as moving average, simple exponential smooth or the naive
                approach (which is just using the last observed value as the forecast for the future) can also be a resort.<br>
